			<p>During his term in office, President Nixon created a shift in the focus in United States towards drug abuse. In 1970, under President Nixon, Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which reduced penalties for marijuana possession, allowed no-knock searches, and included the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act established the drug categories known as “Schedules”. Then, in 1971Nixon announced the Special Action for Drug Abuse Prevention to allocate more money towards drug abuse treatment and in 1972 he founded the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement to fight the drug war at a localized street level. Finally, in 1973 Nixon established the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nixon played a vital role in how the United States viewed drug use. The topic of drug use and drug abuse began to grow into a larger issue in the eyes of the public and the government.</p>
			<p>Later, under President Carter, eleven states decriminalized marijuana and the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to decriminalize the possession of an ounce of marijuana. The United States saw a drift towards drug usage tolerance, however the election of President Reagan led to a new emphasis on the Drug War. Nancy Reagan started the “Just Say No” campaign, the D.A.R.E drug education program organization started, and zero-tolerance policies were put in place. Because of the new policies, the incarceration rates began to increase dramatically. (See the Data Page for more information). In 1986 President Reagan signed The Anti-Drug Abuse Act to allocated large portions of money towards fighting the drug war, establishing prisons, education programs, and treatment programs. One of the most notable pieces of the act was the creation of mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses. The reinforcement of the war on drugs continued through the presidency of Bush who created the Office of National Drug Control Policy in 1989.</p>
			<p>In the past decade, there has been a noticeable shift of the view on the War On Drugs. This may be due to the overwhelming incarceration rates or a desire for more individual freedoms. Whatever the case may be, reform has been notable since the early 2000s. In 2004, New York created the Drug Policy Reform Act to lower drug sentencing and increase eligibility for prison-based treatments of drug abuse. 
While the Office of National Drug Control Policy openly opposes the legalization of marijuana and other drugs, many states have legalized marijuana usage in various scales. Public support of marijuana legalization has risen to a fifty-two percent favor of legalization (See Data page) (cite that link). Then in 2013 the Obama Administration changed the emphasis from “The War On Drugs” to “National Drug Control Strategy”. This shift focused on emphasizing prevention of drug abuse over incarceration. </p>
			<p>Currently, the issue of drug use is still prominent in the United States. However, views on drug policies have shifted away from criminalization and government control. Instead, the focus has been on reform and emphasizing rehabilitation. After decades of increasing government control concerning drug use, the creation of numerous organizations to wage war on drugs, and massive incarceration rates, the United States is revealing a change in ideas. The War On Drugs has changed, but many questions concerning reform remain on the back-burner.</p>
