        <p>	The US spends about 51,000,000,000 dollars annually on the War on Drugs. President Nixon coined the term “War on Drugs” in 1971 with an initial budget of 100,000 dollars. In 2012, 1.55 million people were arrested on nonviolent drug charges. For most of the forty plus years since it began, the War on Drugs has become a part of the American main agenda. Recently, though, Americans have begun to take a look at this War on Drugs and question it. Our topic Revisiting the War on Drugs: Repercussions and Reform in the 21st Century explores this change in Americans attitudes toward the War on Drugs. This wiki explores questions such as should we still be locking up nonviolent drug users and where is the line on imprisonment? What could drugs offer medically? What has 9/11 done to affect the war on drugs? How has drug use and drug culture changed in the 21st century?</p>

			<div class="page-header"><h1>Historical Context</h1></div>
			<p>During his term in office, President Nixon created a shift in the focus in United States towards drug abuse. In 1970, under President Nixon, Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which reduced penalties for marijuana possession, allowed no-knock searches, and included the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act established the drug categories known as “Schedules”. Then, in 1971Nixon announced the Special Action for Drug Abuse Prevention to allocate more money towards drug abuse treatment and in 1972 he founded the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement to fight the drug war at a localized street level. Finally, in 1973 Nixon established the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nixon played a vital role in how the United States viewed drug use. The topic of drug use and drug abuse began to grow into a larger issue in the eyes of the public and the government(A Brief History of the Drug War).</p>
			
            <p>Later, under President Carter, eleven states decriminalized marijuana and the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to decriminalize the possession of an ounce of marijuana. The United States saw a drift towards drug usage tolerance, however the election of President Reagan led to a new emphasis on the Drug War. Nancy Reagan started the “Just Say No” campaign, the D.A.R.E drug education program organization started, and zero-tolerance policies were put in place. Because of the new policies, the incarceration rates began to increase dramatically - see Data Page (Thirty Years of America's Drug War: A Chronology). In 1986 President Reagan signed The Anti-Drug Abuse Act to allocated large portions of money towards fighting the drug war, establishing prisons, education programs, and treatment programs. One of the most notable pieces of the act was the creation of mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses. The reinforcement of the war on drugs continued through the presidency of Bush who created the Office of National Drug Control Policy in 1989 (A Brief History of the Drug War).</p>
        
			<p>In the past decade, there has been a noticeable shift of the view on the War On Drugs. This may be due to the overwhelming incarceration rates or a desire for more individual freedoms. Whatever the case may be, reform has been notable since the early 2000s. In 2004, New York created the Drug Policy Reform Act to lower drug sentencing and increase eligibility for prison-based treatments of drug abuse (Our Victories). While the Office of National Drug Control Policy openly opposes the legalization of marijuana and other drugs (Marijuana Resource Center), many states have legalized marijuana usage in various scales. Public support of marijuana legalization has risen to a fifty-two percent favor of legalization (See Data page) (Majority Now Supports Legalizing Marijuana). Then in 2013 the Obama Administration changed the emphasis from “The War On Drugs” to “National Drug Control Strategy”. This shift focused on emphasizing prevention of drug abuse over incarceration (A Drug Policy for the 21st Century). </p>
        
			<p>Currently, the issue of drug use is still prominent in the United States. However, views on drug policies have shifted away from criminalization and government control. Instead, the focus has been on reform and emphasizing rehabilitation. After decades of increasing government control concerning drug use, the creation of numerous organizations to wage war on drugs, and massive incarceration rates, the United States is revealing a change in ideas. The War On Drugs has changed, but many questions concerning reform remain on the back-burner.</p>
