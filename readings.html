        <p>The following readings are divided into two main categories in order to better allow you to answer the suggested essay questions. The first category comments on the repercussions of war on drugs on the lives of average Americans. The second category relates to current debates over the accepted uses of certain drugs—focusing particularly on LSD and Marijuana—and the reforms stemming from these discussions.</p>
        <p>Don't forget to watch the <a href="http://ktgilgen.github.io/videos.html">Videos</a> and <a href="http://ktgilgen.github.io/images.html">Images</a>.</p>

        <h2>Section 1 </h2>
        <p>The first category includes the political cartoons found on the Images page, the open letter to Obama from celebrities, Eric Holder’s Speech, an article on police militarization, and the clip from Season 5 of Drugs Inc. </p>
       <p> The political cartoons offer brief insights into the effect that the war on drugs has had on the daily lives of Americans. They illustrate the tendency for the war on drugs to imprison racial minorities and the poor at higher rates than other groups. They also illustrate how the war on drugs’ zero-tolerance policies have lead to mass incarceration instead of treatment. Lastly, these cartoons call attention to America’s hypocritical stance on drugs. These cartoons therefore enhance the first category of readings by offering brief, specific critiques against the war on drugs.</p>
        <p>In an open letter to Obama, celebrities, politicians, clergy members, activists, and academia members have banded together to ask Obama to reform policies from previous decades which have encouraged mass incarceration of minor drug offenders. This letter also specifically lists the war on drugs the culprit. Overall, this document offers the opinion of well-informed citizens on one of the issues surrounding the war on drugs.</p>
        <p>Eric Holder’s speech helps to further illustrate for the reader how the current system of incarceration is flawed. His speech offers an insider’s point of view on the current issue while also emphasizing the reforms that are taking place. His viewpoint both reinforces and contrasts the letter regarding incarceration rates. While he displays the same opinion, he also gives a politician’s viewpoint rather than a citizen’s which shows the political side of the issue.</p>
        <p>The article on police militarization describes another one of the effects of the war on drugs. Following 9/11 and the declaration of the war on terror, our police force has been increasingly militarized but its main efforts have not been directed against terrorism. Instead, this police force has been utilized in the war on drugs. This article enhances this wiki by narrating the history of the war on drugs in conjunction with the war on terror, but also by displaying another way in which the war on drugs as affected the average citizen. </p>
        <p>Lastly, the first category also includes the first clip from the show Drugs Inc. This clip brings to light how drug money affects daily lives by revealing how drug money sometimes funds institutions that are normally thought of as untainted by such associations (including the Mormon Church). Therefore, this document shows exactly how the drug culture pervades everyday lives and institutions.</p>

        <h2>Section 2</h2>
        <p>The second category includes articles both supporting and fighting Marijuana legalization, an article on LSD research, the clip from Season 4 of Drugs Inc., and the DEA’s fact sheets on both LSD and Marijuana. </p>
        <p>The first article in this category comes from the New York Times. This article is the first in a series of pieces published in the Times about why Marijuana should be legalized. Although it is not required that you read all of the series, it is highly suggested because these articles include more data than just this introductory article. However, this article does do a good job of reflecting the current majority opinion of the American people on Marijuana legalization and providing some basic statistics. </p>
       <p> The contrasting opinion is voiced by CNBC. This article presents many data points about Marijuana in order to support its argument against the legalization of Marijuana. This article states that legalizing Marijuana will increase the number of users and be generally detrimental to society. After communicating these points though, the article continues by suggesting that the government ought to crack down even more on Marijuana use instead of being more liberal. This article enhances this category by articulating the current minority opinion in the debate.</p>
        <p>The article on LSD research describes a drug trial done in Switzerland on LSD’s potential positive medical effects. During the 60’s, similar research was also being conducted in America. However, the research was effectively terminated when LSD was listed as a Schedule 1 drug (a drug with no approved medical benefits and the highest potential for abuse). The study has had tentatively positive results. This new perspective on LSD is especially interesting considering the current debate over the legalization of Marijuana (another Schedule 1 drug). </p>
        <p>The second clip from Drugs Inc. falls into this second category. This clip shows a possible medical use for magic mushrooms: curing cluster headaches. The chemicals in magic mushrooms (psilocybin and psilocin) are listed as Schedule 1 drugs along with LSD and Marijuana. This means that those who research or use these drugs for medical purposes risk imprisonment. Once again, this article displays the possible uses for a banned drug, but offers a more specific example than the LSD article.</p>
        <p>These fact sheets from the DEA show their current stance on both LSD and Marijuana. Some of the information contained within these fact sheets is a direct contradiction to the other documents contained within this wiki. The tone is also very pro drug war and even utilizes the term, “abused,” instead of, “consumed,” when describing how the drug is taken. Despite this bias, this article enhances this category by providing the opinion of an official governmental institution on this debate.</p>
